double take,dhruv,in love,"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh   I could say I never dare To think about you in that way But, I would be lying And I pretend I'm happy for you When you find some dude to take home But I won't deny that  In the midst of the crowds In the shapes, in the clouds I don't see nobody but you In my rose-tinted dreams Wrinkled silk on my sheets I don't see nobody but you   Boy, you got me hooked onto something Who could say that they saw us coming? Tell me, do you feel the love? Spend a summer or a lifetime with me Let me take you to the place of your dreams Tell me, do you feel the love? Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh   And I could say I never unzipped Those blue Levi's inside my head But that's far from the truth Don't know what's come over me It seems like yesterday when I said “We'll be friends forever”   Constellations of stars Murals on city walls I don't see nobody but you You're my vice, you're my muse You're a nineteenth floor view I don't see nobody but you You might also like Boy, you got me hooked onto something Who could say that they saw us coming? Tell me, do you feel the love? Spend a summer or a lifetime with me Let me take you to the place of your dreams Tell me, do you feel the love?   Boy, you got me hooked onto something Who could say that they saw us coming? Tell me, do you feel the love? Spend a summer or a lifetime with me Let me take you to the place of your dreams Tell me, do you feel the love?   Do you feel the love?  Do you feel the love? Do you feel the love? Do you feel the love? Feel the love Feel the love15Embed"
If I Ain't Got You,Alicia Keys,in love,"Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power, yeah Some people live just to play the game   Some people think that the physical things Define what's within And I've been there before but that life's a bore So full of the superficial  Some people want it all But I don't want nothin' at all If it ain't you, baby If I ain't got you, baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothing If I ain't got you, yeah   Some people search for a fountain That promises forever young  Some people need three dozen roses And that's the only way to prove you love them   Hand me the world on a silver platter And what good would it be? With no one to share With no one who truly cares for me   Some people want it all But I don't want nothin' at all If it ain't you, baby If I ain't got you, baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothin' If I ain't got you, you, you Some people want it all But I don't want nothin' at all If it ain't you, baby If I ain't got you, baby Some people want diamond rings Some just want everything But everything means nothin' If I ain't got you, yeah You might also like If I ain't got you with me, baby Ooh, ooh Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing If I ain't got you with me, baby99Embed"
