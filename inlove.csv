Feels Like You,Faime,in love,LyricsThose cute guys moving around you They just want a piece of your life Free yourself Suffering this life you started losing your head  In your eyes  I see shame Scratching your face  Feel those lies Spreading around loudly screaming your fame Feels like you never lift the veil seeing under it Ask for commercial before all the audience get bored! In your eyes  I see shame Scratching your face You can't blame If you're just a fake  You can reset to zero don't be afraid Make a new smile and try to sell it well I see shameYou might also likeEmbed

Strawberries & Cigarettes,Troye Sivan,in love,"Remember when we first met? You said, ""Light my cigarette"" So I lied to my mum and dad I jumped the fence and I ran But we couldn't go very far 'Cause you locked your keys in your car So you sat and stared at my lips And I could already feel your kiss   Long nights, daydreams Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you Headlights on me Racing to 60, I've been a fool Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like Blue eyes, black jeans Lighters and candy, I've been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you  Remember when you taught me fate? Said it'd all be worth the wait Like that night in the back of the cab When your fingers walked in my hand Next day, nothin' on my phone But I can still smell you on my clothes Always hoping that things would change But we went right back to your games   Long nights, daydreams Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you Headlights on me Racing to 60, I've been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like Blue eyes, black jeans Lighters and candy, I've been a fool But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you   And even if I run away Give my heart a holiday Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you You always leave me wanting more I can't shake my hunger for Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you Yeah, they always taste like you, you Long nights, daydreams With that sugar and smoke rings Always taste like you You might also like Headlights on me  Racing to 60, I've been a fool  Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like Blue eyes, black jeans  Lighters and candy, I've been a fool  Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you32Embed"

Nothin' on You (feat. Bruno Mars),B.o.B,in love,"LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100. ""All of the Lights"" - Kanye West 99. ""No Lie"" - 2 Chainz feat. Drake 98.

Left, left and right, right Pretty sure that I've been here before And it isn't what I wanted   I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly In a pool full of your love But I don't even know how the chemistry works When you're poolside Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand And stirring up trouble  Your voice like an angel Been chainsmoking all month long Like you're someone I believe in Am I only a lab rat? Someone you can test things on? This isn't what I signed up for I just wanted you to I just wanted  I just wanted you to I just wanted  You might also like I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly In a pool full of your love But I don't even know how the chemistry works When you're poolside Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand And stirring up trouble   I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly In a pool full of your love But I don't even know how the chemistry works When you're poolside Kicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand And stirring up trouble   I just wanted you to watch me dissolve I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly I just wanted you to watch me dissolve I just wanted you to watch me dissolve, slowly17Embed"
